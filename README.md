# Semester One Notes and Resources

Welcome to the Semester Three Notes repository for the CS Majors! This repository provides comprehensive notes and resources for students at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, Topi, Swabi-KPK Pakistan majoring in Computer Science and related fields. These materials aim to help sophomores navigate their academic journey with ease and confidence.

Note: This repository addresses only courses with a higher difficulty level.

## Repository Structure and Instructions

The repository is organized by subjects and topics covered during the third semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources.

### Courses/Subjects

**CE - 221**
  - **Digital Logic Design and Labs (4 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This course should be manageable if you've put in good efforts in making your basics strong. A good instructor in this course can let your thinking and problem solving ability to the next level. Being a CS Major you shall be offered this course with the best instructor there but if you seem that you may lack that opportunity then there are resources available at youtube to help you in the best way possible. One of the most recommended youtube channel is: 'All About Electronics' @ youtube. Always spend your time in going through the basics and implementing them with design problems, usually available at your textbooks or can be asked for by ChatGpt. Continous practice and exposure to problems is the key in excelling in this course.

**DS - 221**
  - **Inferential Statistics and Applied Probablity (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This course is the exact replicated version of ES-221 and hoped to be omitted for the coming batches, nevertheless if you find yourself attending this course then here are the instructions to excel in it. This 3-credit hour course can significantly impact your grade. A-level students may find the pre-midterm section manageable since much of the content is similar to what they had already studied. In contrast, FSC students will need to dedicate considerable time and effort to grasp the material. Solving numerous related problems is crucial for success. However, the post-midterm portion of the course is relatively easier than the pre-midterm section. An instructor may introduce you to concepts of Machine Learning such as Linear Regression, Binary Classification or Principal Component Analysis for higher dimensionality data reduction, its always preferable to pay attention to these crucial topics in class or take considerate help from content available online.

**CS 221**
  - **Data Structures and Algorithms and Labs(4 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This course is all about learning how to manage space and time while coding solution of different problems out there, for this we discuss various data structures and algorithms along the course and compare their time and space complexity thus helping us building an sense of selecting the right option for our given problem, it is advisable that one learn each data structure from the basics through youtube and class lectures and then solve problems of different difficulty levels from LeetCode, this would help you enhance your problem solving skills and you could eventually give a try to competitive coding offered by globally recognized organizations like ICPC etc, the detailed codes of each data structure and algorithm expected to be studied in this course can be found through the DSA dedicated repo through this link: (https://github.com/Harris-giki/DSA_Cpp)


**CS - 231**
  - **Discrete Mathematics (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This is one of the diverse and easiet of the courses being offered in third semester. It includes concepts from statistic, data structures and alogrithms, digital logic design etc altogether making it a good one to study, however the only important instruction for this course is to solve as many exercise questions possible (you can find keys to various exercises uploaded in this repository as well), solving the questions using a definite book described procedure is usually appreciated by the instructors of this course.

**CS - 202**
  - **Introduction to Information Technology (2 Credit Hours)**
This course is one of the most easy in difficulty level, that is being offered in this semester. Based on modern day technological advancement introduction and discussion, this course is quite theoretical with a little definite concepts which are used to make senarios based questions in exams. This course also introduces one to important topics like SQL programming, Terminal Based Commands/Linux System, Machine Learning and Cyber Security. Just pay attention to the lectures, and it would be good to go.
