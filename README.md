## Repository Structure and Instructions

The repository is organized by subjects and topics covered during the third semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources to support learning.

### üìò Courses/Subjects

#### **CE - 221: Digital Logic Design and Labs (4 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This course is manageable with a solid understanding of the basics. A skilled instructor can significantly enhance your problem-solving ability. As a CS major, you will likely be assigned one of the best instructors for this course. However, if you feel the need for additional help, excellent resources are available on YouTube. One highly recommended channel is *'All About Electronics'*. Focus on mastering the basics and apply them to design problems, commonly found in textbooks or through tools like ChatGPT. Consistent practice and problem exposure are key to excelling in this subject.

#### **DS - 221: Inferential Statistics and Applied Probability (3 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This course is a near replica of *ES-221* and may be omitted for future batches. However, if you are enrolled, here are tips for success. A-level students may find the pre-midterm portion manageable due to prior exposure, while FSC students may need to invest extra effort in mastering the material. Post-midterm content is generally easier. Concepts such as Linear Regression, Binary Classification, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) might be introduced. Pay attention during lectures and supplement your learning with reliable online resources.

#### **CS - 221: Data Structures and Algorithms and Labs (4 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This course emphasizes efficient management of space and time in coding solutions. Various data structures and algorithms are studied and compared for their time and space complexity. A recommended approach is to learn each data structure thoroughly from YouTube and class lectures before practicing problems of varying difficulty on platforms like *LeetCode*. This will improve your problem-solving skills and prepare you for competitive coding events like ICPC. A dedicated DSA repository with detailed codes can be accessed here: [DSA Repository](https://github.com/Harris-giki/DSA_Cpp).

#### **CS - 231: Discrete Mathematics (3 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This course, considered one of the most diverse yet easier ones, includes concepts from statistics, data structures, algorithms, and digital logic design. The best strategy for success is to solve as many exercise questions as possible. Answer keys for various exercises are available in this repository. Follow a structured approach as described in the textbooks, as it is often appreciated by instructors.

---

#### **CS - 202: Introduction to Information Technology (2 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This theoretical course introduces modern technological advancements such as SQL programming, terminal-based commands, Linux systems, machine learning, and cybersecurity. The concepts are straightforward, and exam questions are often scenario-based. Active participation in lectures should be sufficient to perform well.
